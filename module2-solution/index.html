	    <div class="menu-desc">&quot;There was this terrible British version of curry cooked at home involving onions, cooking apples, chuck beef and astringent curry powder,&quot; Lawrence says. Jaffrey's recipes promised something else. Here is a deep, rust-coloured Kashmiri rogan josh, bursting with clove and asafoetida. Here's aubergine in the pickling style, here is chana dal and makkhani murgha, or butter chicken. Here is a guidebook for another place entirely.</div>

	    <div class="menu-desc">It's a delicious, if familiar slice of understatement from Nigel (don't expect the journalist's formality of surnames here; he's both friend and colleague). Real Fast Food was not a lead title for Penguin books. It was published on such a tight budget it has no photographs. And yet it swiftly became such a massive success that sales reps had to drive around restocking bookshops from copies they carried in the boot.</div>

	    <div class="menu-desc">Nobody has done a better job of obscuring the early, shimmering brilliance of Marco Pierre White than late-career Marco Pierre White. The gruelling kipper and whisky pâté I was served in one of his steakhouses in 2009 still repeats on me. There's a growing chain of restaurants bearing his name which, while graced by vast pictures of the chef, are less often host to the man himself. Customer reviews have not always been positive. His 2006 ghost-written autobiography, about which I may not have been entirely polite in my review for this paper, was full of gloating accounts of angry outbursts and petty feuds.</div>
